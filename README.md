# Dog Tap Game - Telegram Mini App

Ever wanted your own virtual dog companion? This Telegram Mini App lets you adopt a cute digital dog that you can tap to earn coins, dress up with fun accessories, and take care of through daily missions. It's surprisingly addictive!

Built with React and TypeScript, featuring smooth canvas animations that make your dog feel alive and responsive.

## What makes it fun?

**The Tap Game**: Just tap your dog and watch the coins roll in! With a **200 $DOGG daily limit**, each tap gives you haptic feedback and updates a **progress bar every 10 taps**. Your dog bounces and reacts with **3 smooth animation frames** (0.5-second transitions) - from neutral to excited to super excited!

**Customize Your Pup**: Your dog doesn't have to look boring! Pick from different body types - maybe you want a fluffy poodle-style dog, or a sleek slim one? Then dress them up with hats (caps, crowns, bows) and choose their color. **Drag and drop accessories** with **instant preview** using Canvas/Konva.js rendering, or just tap to apply them. **108 unique combinations** await!

**Daily Missions**: Keep things interesting with daily challenges. Log in for bonus coins, reach tap milestones, or customize your dog for extra rewards. **Lazy-loaded images** optimize performance for low-power devices. There's always something to work towards!

**Smooth Animations**: This isn't just static images - your dog is animated with smooth 60fps canvas rendering powered by **Framer Motion**. It bounces, wags its tail, and even sticks its tongue out when excited. The animations adapt to your screen size too, with **optimized performance** for all devices.

## How it's built

The app is pretty straightforward - here's how I organized everything:

```

### Tech choices

I went with **React + TypeScript** because it's reliable and makes development much smoother. The game state is pretty simple - just React hooks with localStorage to save your progress. Everything resets daily except your total coins and customizations.

For the **animations**, I used Konva.js which gives smooth 60fps canvas rendering, enhanced with **Framer Motion** for UI transitions. The dog has **3 animation frames** with **0.5-second transitions** that cycle through, and when you tap, it triggers bounce effects and ripples. I had to be careful about cleaning up animations to avoid memory leaks.

**Telegram integration** was interesting - I used their WebApp SDK for haptic feedback (those little vibrations when you tap), and made sure it works across different Telegram versions. Some older versions don't support all features, so there's fallback handling. **Security is handled through initData validation** - the app validates Telegram's authentication data to ensure users are legitimate.

The **game state** looks like this:

```typescript
interface GameState {
  coins: number; // Your total coins
  tapsCount: number; // Lifetime taps
  dogCustomization: DogCustomization; // How your dog looks
  dailyTapsCount: number; // Today's taps (resets daily)
  hasCustomizedToday: boolean; // For daily missions
  lastLoginDate: string; // To know when to reset
  rewardedMissions: string[]; // Which missions you've claimed
}
```

## Running it locally

Want to try it out or make changes? Here's how to get it running:

**What you need:**

- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm (comes with Node.js)

**Getting started:**

```bash
# Get the code
git clone <repository-url>
cd telegram-mini-app

# Install everything
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:5173`. It works in any browser, but for the full Telegram experience (haptic feedback, etc.), you'll need to set it up as a Telegram Mini App.

**For production:**

```bash
npm run build
```

**API setup** (optional):
If you want to connect to a real API for missions, create a `.env` file:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-endpoint.com
```

Otherwise, it'll just use mock data, which works fine for development.

export const GAME_CONFIG = {
  COINS_PER_TAP: 1, // Coins earned per tap
  DAILY_TAP_LIMIT: 200, // 200 $DOGG daily limit
  MILESTONE_TAPS: 50, // Haptic feedback interval
  PROGRESS_BAR_INTERVAL: 10, // Progress bar updates every 10 taps
} as const;

export const ANIMATION_CONFIG = {
  FRAME_DURATION: 500, // 0.5 second transitions as per requirements
  TAP_EFFECT_DURATION: 200, // Tap effect duration (ms)
  TOTAL_ANIMATION_DURATION: 1500, // 3 frames × 0.5 seconds = 1.5 seconds total
} as const;
```

### Dog Customization Options

## 🔄 API Integration

### Mission API

The app expects REST API endpoints with proper authentication:

#### Authentication Headers

All API requests include:

```http
Content-Type: application/json
X-Telegram-Init-Data: <telegram_init_data>
X-Telegram-User-ID: <user_id>
```

#### GET `/getMissions`

Returns available missions:

```typescript
interface Mission {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  reward: number;
  completed: boolean;
  imageUrl?: string;
  type: "tap_count" | "customization" | "daily_login" | "manual";
  target?: number;
  progress?: number;
  rewarded?: boolean;
}
```

#### GET `/getTaps`

Returns current tap status for the user:

```typescript
interface TapStatus {
  dailyTapsCount: number;
  totalTapsCount: number;
  coinsEarned: number;
  canTap: boolean;
  remainingTaps: number;
}
```

### Mock Data Fallback

If the API is unavailable, the app automatically falls back to mock data, ensuring uninterrupted development and testing.

## Problems I ran into (and how I solved them)

**Getting smooth 60fps animations was tricky.** The dog needs to animate constantly, plus handle tap effects, all while staying responsive. I ended up using Konva.js for hardware acceleration and being really careful about cleaning up animation intervals. The key was separating the animation logic from React's render cycle.

**Telegram WebApp compatibility is... interesting.** Different Telegram versions support different features, so I had to build in version detection. Older versions don't have haptic feedback or header customization, so the app gracefully falls back to just working without those features.

**Daily resets while keeping long-term progress** was a fun puzzle. I wanted missions to reset daily but keep your total coins and customizations. The solution was checking the date on app load and resetting only the daily stuff if it's a new day.

**Making it work on all screen sizes** took some CSS wrestling. Mobile screens vary wildly, so I used CSS Grid and Flexbox with responsive breakpoints. Everything scales properly from tiny phones to tablets.

**Converting SVG designs to canvas animations** was probably the most complex part. I had to break down the dog SVG into individual Konva elements (circles, ellipses, paths) and make them configurable for different body types and colors. Each animation frame tweaks different properties.

## Deploying it

**Setting up the Telegram bot:**

1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram
2. Create a new bot and get your token
3. Set up the Mini App URL in your bot settings
4. If you're using a real API, configure webhook endpoints

**Where to host it:**

- **Vercel** - My favorite, zero-config with automatic HTTPS
- **Netlify** - Also great, just drag and drop your build folder
- **GitHub Pages** - Free and works fine for static sites
- **Your own server** - If you need more control

**Before going live:**

- [ ] Set up environment variables
- [ ] Make sure your API is secure (if using one)
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled (required for Telegram Mini Apps)
- [ ] Test it in Telegram
- [ ] Maybe add some error tracking
